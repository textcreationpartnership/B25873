            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU see at last, Sir, that we know how to make good use of the prudent counsels you gave us. notwithstanding the objections of those speculative Gentlemen, who could not believe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were capable to make themselves absolute Masters, of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accustom'd to overcome, which treated them with contempt, and who were so proud and so jealous of their liberty, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y suppos'd they could never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently limit and restrain the Regal power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which they endeavour'd even in the Reigns of their most just and most moderate Kings, whatsoever care these coud take to please them, we have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less found out the way to subject them intirely, and to oblige them to act blindfold whatever is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our interests. You see Sir, the advantage we have made, and how dextrously we have pursu'd your advice, to engage this Kingdom in a war very like to ruine their trade for ever, to consume their bravest men in the flower of their strength, and take from them all possibility of ever recovering that liberty they had so long abus'd to the prejudice of their Soveraigns; and which, had they been wise, they might have longer preserv'd against that which is call'd our Usurpation. To maintain which, it was yet further necessary to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our selves pursuant to your advice, with an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>my wholly devoted to our Prince, and therefore we hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor do we forget to lay hold on all occasions, of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the Realm, by little and little, all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Army, yet imbued with the principles of hatred this Nation ever had, for Arbitrary Government, and the Dom nion of Strangers. And that which is most admirable in our conduct, is, that those very troops we expose in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and elsewhere, to all the dangers of the war, whose loss cannot but be advantagious to our Prince, do nevertheless serve, to keep in awe all the Republican party of the chief Cities of <hi>Holla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>You will, with me confess, more solid measures coud never have been taken to establish, at one and the same time, a despotick power both over <hi>England,</hi> and over the United Provinces. It is true, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all our care to perswade this people, and above all the Parliament, of the necessity of a forreign Army.

            <p>Neither are we unmindful, to rid our selves, as you wisely advis'd, of all the troublesome Lovers and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of liberty; and of the clear sighted men, who d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean while, we, the few friends and confidents of the Prince, are of opinion, we cannot do him, or our selves better service, than by rendring him inaccessible t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I make no doubt but you have taken notice, that we have not neglected your advice concerning the great body of this Common-weal, the Merchants; of whom it is certain we should have been afraid, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that state of opulency wherein we found them.
<pb facs="tcp:196405:2"/> We could not have given them a more uneasy shock than that of the Embargo; whereby, under pretence of the necessity of having Vessels and Seamen for the War against <hi>Franc,</hi> we made the English Merchants lose, according to their own computation, above three mill o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It must indeed be acknowledged, that the most clear fighted Merchants of <hi>London</hi> murmur extremely against this proceeding, and believe that not only their navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and traffick, but also Men of War for Convoys might have been allowed them: and some of them are so bold as to say, that they were full as happy under the Reigns of their lawful Kings, as now they are really miserable under the arbitrary power of the Usurper. But we know well enough how to silence these mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous tongues; and believe me, there is nothing more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
